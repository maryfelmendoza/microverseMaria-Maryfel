     <p>Charging a tokenized card</p>
     <p>Everyone likes to receive payments, this is why we start with a tutorial to see how to do it.
        This tutorial uses the Openpay.js library to send the card information directly to Openpay. 
        Using this library, besides being the easiest way to save a card, 
        it minimizes the scope of a PCI Compliance certification.</p>

    <p>3D Secure</p>
    <p>Below is the flow of how a charge is made using the 3d Secure process:
        Below are the fields of the POST form, which must comply with current web standards 
        like url-encoding, headers with user-agent, content-lenght, etc. to ensure maximum 
        compatibility with current browsers.</p>

    <li>Create secure 3D transactions. - 
      You must create in Openpay a transaction indicating that you want to use 3D Secure. 
      See: Charge with token.</li>
    <li>Authentication url sent. - 
      The response from step 1 will be the URL to which the client should be re-directed 
      to perform the 3D Secure process.</li>
    <li>Re-direction to Authentication URL. - 
      Once the trade has the authentication URL, you must redirect the client to the same.</li><br><br>
